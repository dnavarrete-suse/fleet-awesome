### OpenZiti Zrok

Geo-scale, next-generation peer-to-peer sharing platform built on top of OpenZiti. Zero-trust zrok controller and zrok frontend components as a K8s deployment.

Minimal example with nginx-ingress [from documentation](https://github.com/openziti/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/zrok#minimal-example-with-nginx-ingress).

_TODO_
- [ ] testing different environmental situations
- [x] provide minimal staring values.yaml sample from Docs
