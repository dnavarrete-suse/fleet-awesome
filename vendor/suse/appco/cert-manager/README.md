### Cert-Manager Chart

Cert-manager is a powerful and extensible X.509 certificate controller for Kubernetes and OpenShift workloads. It will obtain certificates from a variety of Issuers, both popular public Issuers as well as private Issuers, and ensure the certificates are valid and up-to-date, and will attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.

See [Application Collection Documentation](https://apps.rancher.io/applications/cert-manager) for this chart.
