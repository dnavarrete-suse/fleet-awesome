### External Secrets Operator (ESO)

Synchronize secrets from many Providers, similar to Rancher's provisioning-sync or bootstrap-sync controllers.
This package is built by Application Collection from upstream sources.

See the [AppCo Docs](https://apps.rancher.io/applications/external-secrets-operator) for more information.

Note: The upstream developers only [test against](https://external-secrets.io/latest/introduction/stability-support/) the latest version of Kubernetes.
