### Valkey Chart

Valkey is a high-performance data structure server that primarily serves key/value workloads. It supports a wide range of native structures and an extensible plugin system for adding new data structures and access patterns. This project was forked from the open source Redis project right before the transition to their new source available licenses.

See [Application Collection Documentation](https://apps.rancher.io/applications/valkey) for this chart.
