### Zot Registry

A production-ready vendor-neutral OCI image registry - images stored in OCI image format, distribution specification on-the-wire, simplified.

Doccumentation for zot is located at: [https://zotregistry.dev](https://zotregistry.dev)

_TODO_
- [x] configmap, namespace, and values.yaml
- [ ] testing different values options
- [ ] `helm.takeOwnership: false` so the namespace can exist prior to the chart, see cmvalues kuztomization fleet bundle
- [ ] common tasks for oci image content as [in the zot docs](https://zotregistry.dev/v2.1.2/user-guides/user-guide-datapath/)
